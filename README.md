## Goal & Description

### The technology

* Insert explanation and list of ds tools
* A flask app serves as the prediction endpoint endpoint
* The entire pipeline process has been containerized and deployed using Docker

1 - Python 3.6+

To install main dependencies, just run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
All other packages used are available individually via, pip install

2 - Docker / DockerToolBox

### Running
The primary file that calls each of the functions is titled **insertname.py**
